# Natural-Language-to-SQL-Engine
I developed a natural language-to-SQL query generator using LangChain and SQL frameworks. The system interprets human language input, generates corresponding SQL queries, and executes them on a specified database. The entire process is seamlessly integrated into a Flask-based web interface for user-friendly interaction.
