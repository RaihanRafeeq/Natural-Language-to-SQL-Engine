I developed a natural language-to-SQL query generator using LangChain and SQL frameworks, integrated with a Flask-based web interface. 
The interface allows users to input database credentials (name, username, and password) to establish a connection with a local database. 
Once connected, users can enter queries in natural language, which are processed using LangChain to generate and execute SQL queries. T
he corresponding results are then displayed within the interface, providing an intuitive and seamless database interaction experience.
